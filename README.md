# ChessAI
An A.I. in the process of making, to play chess xd.

Made with C++ and SDL2.

Update 1:
 - Made a game window and displayed the chessboard on the screen.

Update 2:
 - Created the Object class to create the pieces and created a loop that goes through the `startingFEN` variable to creates pieces to render on the screen.
